# Plex Finder

This app's goal is to help choose a film to watch when neither you nor your SO/friend/roommate/whatever is any good at
choosing anything. It works like a dating app: swipe, match and watch (I may use this as a catchphrase in the future).

## NOTE: THIS IS VERY MUCH IN PRE-PRE-PRE-ALPHA STATE AND DOESN'T WORK YET. THERE'S NO POINT IN CLONING THIS REPO.
